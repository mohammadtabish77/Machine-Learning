    "### Q1. Probability of Being a Smoker Given Health Insurance Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that an employee is a smoker given that they use the company's health insurance plan, we can use Bayes' Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- \\( P(I) \\) = Probability of using the health insurance plan = 0.70\n",
    "- \\( P(S | I) \\) = Probability of being a smoker given using the plan = 0.40\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find \\( P(S | I) \\), which is already given as 0.40. So the answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(S | I) = 0.40 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Difference Between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Naive Bayes** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** are two types of Naive Bayes classifiers used for different types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "  - Assumes binary/boolean features (0 or 1).\n",
    "  - Useful for binary or presence/absence data.\n",
    "  - Models the probability of features as Bernoulli-distributed (i.e., binary outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "  - Assumes features follow a multinomial distribution.\n",
    "  - Suitable for data where features are counts or frequencies (e.g., word counts in text classification).\n",
    "  - Models the probability of features as counts in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Handling Missing Values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes doesn't handle missing values directly. Common strategies to address missing values before applying Bernoulli Naive Bayes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imputation**: Fill missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the available data.\n",
    "- **Drop**: Remove rows with missing values.\n",
    "- **Create a Missing Indicator**: Introduce an additional feature to indicate missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Gaussian Naive Bayes for Multi-class Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, **Gaussian Naive Bayes** can be used for multi-class classification. It assumes that the features follow a Gaussian distribution and can handle multiple classes by applying the same Gaussian distribution assumption to each class."
