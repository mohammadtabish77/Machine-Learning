    "### Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and How Does It Differ from Other Regression Techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)** is a type of linear regression that includes an L1 regularization term in its objective function. This regularization term penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients, which can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero, thus performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** The objective function for Lasso Regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Minimize } \\| \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\|^2_2 + \\lambda \\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_1 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the vector of observed values,\n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the matrix of input features,\n",
    "- \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is the vector of coefficients,\n",
    "- \\(\\lambda\\) (lambda) is the regularization parameter,\n",
    "- \\(\\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|_1\\) represents the L1 norm of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from Other Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Regularization Type:** Lasso uses L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, unlike Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) that only shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:** Lasso performs implicit feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, whereas Ridge Regression includes all features but shrinks their coefficients.\n",
    "- **Model Complexity:** Lasso can lead to sparser models, which can be advantageous in high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the Main Advantage of Using Lasso Regression in Feature Selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to perform **automatic feature selection**. The L1 regularization term encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates, which means that it can drive some coefficients to exactly zero. This effectively selects a subset of features, making the model simpler and potentially more interpretable, especially in high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How Do You Interpret the Coefficients of a Lasso Regression Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients in a Lasso Regression model represent the relationship between each feature and the response variable, but with an added constraint due to regularization. Here's how to interpret them:\n",
    "- **Non-zero Coefficients:** Features with non-zero coefficients are considered relevant to the model. The magnitude of these coefficients indicates the strength of the relationship between those features and the response variable.\n",
    "- **Zero Coefficients:** Features with zero coefficients are excluded from the model. Lasso Regression uses this property to perform feature selection and reduce model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Tuning Parameters in Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning Parameter:**\n",
    "- **Lambda (\\(\\lambda\\)):** This is the regularization parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. Increasing \\(\\lambda\\) increases the penalty on the size of the coefficients, leading to more coefficients being set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effects on Model Performance:**\n",
    "- **Low \\(\\lambda\\):** Results in a model closer to OLS Regression, with fewer coefficients set to zero.\n",
    "- **High \\(\\lambda\\):** Results in a sparser model with more coefficients set to zero, which can improve generalization but might lead to underfitting if set too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Can Lasso Regression Be Used for Non-Linear Regression Problems? If Yes, How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is inherently a linear model, so it is suited for linear relationships between features and the response variable. However, you can use it in the context of non-linear regression problems by:\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Creating polynomial features or interactions among features, which allows Lasso to handle non-linear relationships through these engineered features.\n",
    "- **Kernel Methods:** Applying Lasso to models that use kernel transformations (like Kernel Ridge Regression) to capture non-linear patterns in a higher-dimensional feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What is the Difference Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization:**\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):** Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. It shrinks coefficients but does not set any to zero.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):** Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection:**\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression:** Does not perform feature selection; all features are included but with smaller coefficients.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression:** Performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coefficient Shrinkage:**\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression:** All coefficients are shrunk, but none are eliminated.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression:** Some coefficients are completely eliminated, leading to a sparser model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can Lasso Regression Handle Multicollinearity in the Input Features? If Yes, How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity. By including the L1 regularization term, Lasso helps stabilize the coefficient estimates in the presence of multicollinearity. The L1 penalty tends to select one feature from a group of highly correlated features and set others to zero, thus reducing the effect of multicollinearity by selecting a smaller, more relevant subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. How Do You Choose the Optimal Value of the Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods to Choose Optimal \\(\\lambda\\):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model performance across different values of \\(\\lambda\\). The value of \\(\\lambda\\) that provides the best performance on validation data is chosen.\n",
    "2. **Grid Search:** Evaluate a range of \\(\\lambda\\) values systematically to find the one that optimizes model performance based on metrics like RMSE, MAE, or other relevant criteria.\n",
    "3. **Regularization Path Algorithms:** Algorithms such as the LARS (Least Angle Regression) can compute the entire regularization path efficiently, allowing you to select an optimal \\(\\lambda\\) based on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso Regression is a powerful technique for linear modeling and feature selection, and understanding its tuning and application can help you build more interpretable and generalizable models."
