    "**2. Exploring the Relationship:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the relationship between age and soft drink preference, we typically use visualization techniques and statistical methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization:** Plotting the data can provide initial insights. A scatter plot with age on the x-axis and different markers/colors for each soft drink preference can help visualize any patterns or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis:** Since soft drink preference is categorical (nominal), and age is continuous, methods such as chi-square tests or contingency tables can be used to test for independence or association between age and soft drink preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Chi-square Test of Independence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a chi-square test, we would set up a contingency table that counts the number of individuals in each age category who prefer each brand of soft drink. This allows us to assess whether there is a significant association between age and soft drink preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's hypothesize the null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) that age and soft drink preference are independent versus the alternative hypothesis \\( H_A \\) that they are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis assuming independence.\n",
    "- Compute the chi-square statistic and compare it against a critical value or p-value threshold to determine statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the chi-square test:\n",
    "- If the test shows a significant result (p-value < 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between age and soft drink preference.\n",
    "- If the test does not show a significant result (p-value >= 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant association between age and soft drink preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the survey data provided, you would proceed with plotting the data, performing a chi-square test of independence, and interpreting the results to understand whether there is a relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink. This approach ensures a systematic analysis of the survey results to draw meaningful conclusions about the studied relationship."
