    "**Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filter method** in feature selection assesses the relevance of each feature independently of the machine learning model. It works by applying statistical techniques to rank or score features based on certain criteria, such as correlation, mutual information, or statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working of Filter Method:**\n",
    "  - **Step 1:** Calculate a metric (e.g., correlation coefficient, chi-square statistic, mutual information) for each feature with respect to the target variable.\n",
    "  - **Step 2:** Rank or score features based on this metric.\n",
    "  - **Step 3:** Select the top-ranked features or those that exceed a certain threshold.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This method is computationally efficient as it does not involve training the model; instead, it relies on statistical measures to evaluate feature importance."

    "**Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrapper method** evaluates feature subsets by training the machine learning model iteratively with different combinations of features. It directly uses the performance of the model (e.g., accuracy, error rate) to select the best subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Differences:**\n",
    "  - **Evaluation:** Wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by training the model iteratively, whereas Filter method evaluates features independently of the model.\n",
    "  - **Computational Cost:** Wrapper method is computationally expensive since it involves training the model multiple times, whereas Filter method is generally faster.\n",
    "  - **Selection Criteria:** Wrapper method uses model performance to select features, while Filter method uses statistical measures.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedded methods** perform feature selection as part of the model construction process. Some common techniques include:\n",
    "- **Lasso (L1 regularization):** Penalizes the absolute size of coefficients, pushing less informative features towards zero.\n",
    "- **Decision Trees:** Feature importance is determined based on how often a feature is used in the tree construction process.\n",
    "- **Elastic Net:** Combines L1 and L2 regularization to balance between sparsity and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods automatically select features during model training, integrating feature selection into the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited to Univariate Relationships:** Filter methods evaluate features independently and may not capture interactions between features, which can be crucial in some datasets.\n",
    "- **Ignores Model Performance:** Since it does not consider the model's behavior, it may select features that, while individually relevant, do not contribute optimally to the model's predictive power.\n",
    "- **Sensitive to Correlated Features:** Filter methods may retain highly correlated features, which could lead to redundancy in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature selection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Filter method** when:\n",
    "- **Large Dataset:** It is computationally efficient for large datasets where Wrapper methods might be impractical.\n",
    "- **Initial Exploration:** For quick initial insights into feature importance before diving deeper into model-specific performance.\n",
    "- **Independence Assumption Holds:** When features are expected to have independent or weakly correlated relationships with the target variable."
