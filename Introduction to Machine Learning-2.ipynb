    "\n",
    "**Overfitting:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new, unseen data. Essentially, the model becomes too complex and captures noise along with the underlying patterns.\n",
    "- **Consequences:** The model performs well on training data but fails to generalize to new data, leading to poor performance on unseen examples.\n",
    "- **Mitigation:** Techniques to mitigate overfitting include:\n",
    "  - **Cross-validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "  - **Regularization:** Add penalties to the loss function that discourage overly complex models.\n",
    "  - **Simplifying the model:** Reduce model complexity by reducing the number of features, pruning decision trees, or using simpler algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underfitting:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern of the data. The model fails to learn from the training data and performs poorly on both training and new data.\n",
    "- **Consequences:** The model shows low accuracy and high error rates on both training and test datasets.\n",
    "- **Mitigation:** Techniques to mitigate underfitting include:\n",
    "  - **Increasing model complexity:** Add more features, use more complex models, or tune hyperparameters to allow the model to capture more patterns in the data.\n",
    "  - **Adding more data:** Provide more training examples to help the model learn better."

    "\n",
    "To reduce overfitting, we can:\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Add penalties to the loss function (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization) to discourage overly complex models.\n",
    "- **Cross-validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "- **Reduce model complexity:** Simplify the model by reducing the number of features, pruning decision trees, or using simpler algorithms.\n",
    "- **Early stopping:** Stop training the model when performance on a validation set starts to degrade.\n",
    "- **Ensemble methods:** Combine predictions from multiple models to improve generalization."

    "- **Definition:** The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the dilemma in machine learning between bias (error from erroneous assumptions) and variance (sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set).\n",

    "  - **High bias:** Leads to underfitting and poor performance on both training and test data.\n",
